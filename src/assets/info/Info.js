  bio: (
    <>
      Hello! I'm Daniel Milad. With previous experience at FinTech startup
      INKPAY, I'm currently working as a freelancer.
      <br />
      <br />I work with brands and businesses designing and developing front-end
      solutions using ReactJS, complete solutions with the MERN stack, and web3
      solutions using Solidity.
      <br />
      <br />
      Within the web3 space, I'm a founder & project manager of the successful
      NFT project 'Pink Flamingo Social Club' - the first multichain NFT
      collection, and cultivated valueable partnerships with Multichain,
      Chainlink and Polygon Studios to name a few.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm passionate about developing technology solutions that help empower
      brands, artists, and communities to thrive using AI and Web3.
